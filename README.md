## Introduction
#CuriousCoffee is a initiative designed to break down silos within Companies House and match participants with people from different departments. Participants can register on the site, and the system will ad-hoc match participants and email them to inform them they've been matched and with who. It's then up to the matched participants to decide what to do next.

## Config
